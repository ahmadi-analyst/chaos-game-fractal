# Interactive Chaos Game Fractal Generator

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that interactively generates fractals using the Chaos Game method. The notebook allows users to explore different fractal patterns by adjusting the number of vertices, the ratio of movement towards the vertices, and the number of random points generated.

## Interactive Notebook

You can run the notebook interactively using Binder or Google Colab. Adjust the sliders to change the number of vertices, the ratio, and the number of points to see how the fractal evolves.

### Run in Binder

### Run in Google Colab

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/your-username/chaos-game-fractal/blob/main/chaos_game_fractal.ipynb)

## Features

- **Number of Vertices**: Set the number of vertices for the polygon (3 to 20).
- **Ratio**: Adjust the ratio of movement towards the selected vertex (0 to 1).
- **Number of Points**: Choose the number of points to be generated (1,000 to 50,000).

## Usage

1. Open the notebook in Binder or Google Colab using the badges above.
2. Use the sliders to set the number of vertices, the ratio, and the number of points.
3. The plot updates automatically to display the resulting fractal.
